    Road is maintained until Rock Canyon Campground located 10 miles down Squaw Peak Road
    leaving 3.4 miles of rocky and rutted dirt road to the trail head. From the trail
    head Provo peak is maybe 1.5 miles to the Peak however each step is directly upward.

    along the humble trails to Y Mountain. Past the Y the trail narrows and lessens in
    elevation gain (it's still steep). This trail enters into some small groves of trees
    and meadows on it's way to the top of Y mountain. When you finally get to the top
    there are two points. The Y mountain overlook which looks out over the valley and the
    actual Y mountain peak which gives a spectacular view of the mountains and valleys on

    <p style="margin-top:0px">Dry Canyon is a short hike up a beautiful canyon in Utah
    Valley. The trail is well maintained but is not frequented much. &nbsp;The trail
    follows a water pipe that runs along the entire length of the trail and at points you
    can hear the water gurgling beneath you. The trail is about the same steepness as all
    the other canyons in the area. At the top of Dry Canyou you can take trail back to
    the cliffs of the canyon walls. Upon reaching one of the cliffs there is a
    breathtaking view of Utah Valley and Utah Lake. Definitely a fun short hike.</p>
